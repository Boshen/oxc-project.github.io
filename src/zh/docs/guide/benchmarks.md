# Benchmarks

How much difference does **OXC** have in speed compared to major parsers such as **SWC**?

The answer is more than double! :)

Look at these results!

There is a 2-fold speed difference compared to **SWC**!

When it comes to _Lint_, the difference is dozens of times greater!  
**OXC** is evolving day by day, so these results are not necessarily the same as today's results.  
but the fact remains that it is the fastest :)
