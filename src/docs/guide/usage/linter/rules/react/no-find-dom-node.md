# react/no-find-dom-node

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
âœ… This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

This rule disallows the use of `findDOMNode`.

### Why is this bad?

`findDOMNode` is an escape hatch used to access the underlying DOM node.
In most cases, use of this escape hatch is discouraged because it pierces the component abstraction.
[It has been deprecated in `StrictMode`.](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html#warning-about-deprecated-finddomnode-usage)

### Example

```javascript
class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView();
  }
  render() {
    return <div />;
  }
}
```
