<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
âœ… This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow undeclared variables in JSX

### Why is this bad?

It is most likely a potential ReferenceError caused by a misspelling of a variable or parameter name.

### Example

```jsx
const A = () => <App />;
const C = <B />;
```
