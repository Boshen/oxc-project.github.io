# jest/no-jasmine-globals

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="fix">
🛠️ An auto-fix is available for this rule for some violations.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

This rule reports on any usage of Jasmine globals, which is not ported to Jest, and suggests alternatives from Jest's own API.

### Example
```javascript
jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL = 5000;
test('my test', () => {
    pending();
});
test('my test', () => {
    jasmine.createSpy();
});
```
