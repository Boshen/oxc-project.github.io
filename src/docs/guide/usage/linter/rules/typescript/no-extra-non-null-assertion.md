# typescript/no-extra-non-null-assertion

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
âœ… This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow extra non-null assertions.

### Why is this bad?
The `!` non-null assertion operator in TypeScript is used to assert that a value's type does not include null or undefined. Using the operator any more than once on a single value does nothing.

### Example
```javascript
const foo: { bar: number } | null = null;
const bar = foo!!!.bar;
```
