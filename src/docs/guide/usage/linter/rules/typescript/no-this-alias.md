# typescript/no-this-alias

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
âœ… This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow unnecessary constraints on generic types.

### Why is this bad?

Generic type parameters (<T>) in TypeScript may be "constrained" with an extends keyword.
When no extends is provided, type parameters default a constraint to unknown. It is therefore redundant to extend from any or unknown.

the rule doesn't allow const {allowedName} = this
this is to keep 1:1 with eslint implementation
sampe with obj.<allowedName> = this

```

```
