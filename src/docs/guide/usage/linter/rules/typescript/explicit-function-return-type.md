# typescript/explicit-function-return-type

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does
This rule enforces that functions do have an explicit return type annotation.

### Why is this bad?
Explicit return types do make it visually more clear what type is returned by a function.
They can also speed up TypeScript type checking performance in large codebases with many large functions.

### Example
```javascript
```
