# typescript/consistent-indexed-object-style

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="fix">
üõ†Ô∏è An auto-fix is available for this rule for some violations.
</span>
</div>

### What it does
Require or disallow the `Record` type.

### Why is this bad?
Inconsistent style for indexed object types can harm readability in a project.

### Example
With "record":

```javascript
// bad
interface Foo {
 [key: string]: unknown;
}
type Foo = {
 [key: string]: unknown;
};
```

With "index-signature":

```javascript
// bad
type Foo = Record<string, unknown>;
```
