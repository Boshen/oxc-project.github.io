# typescript/ban-ts-comment

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="fix">
üõ†Ô∏è An auto-fix is available for this rule for some violations.
</span>
</div>

### What it does
This rule lets you set which directive comments you want to allow in your codebase.

### Why is this bad?
Using TypeScript directives to suppress TypeScript compiler errors
reduces the effectiveness of TypeScript overall.

### Example
```javascript
if (false) {
  // @ts-ignore: Unreachable code error
  console.log('hello');
}
```
