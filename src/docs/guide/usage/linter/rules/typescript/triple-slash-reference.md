# typescript/triple-slash-reference

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
âœ… This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow certain triple slash directives in favor of ES6-style import declarations.

### Why is this bad?

Use of triple-slash reference type directives is generally discouraged in favor of ECMAScript Module imports.

### Example

```ts
/// <reference lib="code" />
globalThis.value;
```
