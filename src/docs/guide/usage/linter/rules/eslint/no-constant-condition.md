# eslint/no-constant-condition

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
âœ… This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow constant expressions in conditions

### Why is this bad?

A constant expression (for example, a literal) as a test condition might be a typo or development trigger for a specific behavior.

### Example

```javascript
if (false) {
  doSomethingUnfinished();
}
```
