# eslint/no-dupe-keys

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
âœ… This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow duplicate keys in object literals

### Why is this bad?

Multiple properties with the same key in object literals can cause unexpected behavior in your application.

### Example

```javascript
var foo = {
  bar: "baz",
  bar: "qux",
};
```
