# eslint/no-eq-null

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="fix">
‚ö†Ô∏èüõ†Ô∏èÔ∏è A dangerous auto-fix is available for this rule.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow null comparisons without type-checking operators.

### Why is this bad?

Comparing to null without a type-checking operator (== or !=), can have unintended results as the comparison will evaluate to true when comparing to not just a null, but also an undefined value.

### Example

```javascript
if (foo == null) {
  bar();
}
```
