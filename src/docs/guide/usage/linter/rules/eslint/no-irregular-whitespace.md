# eslint/no-irregular-whitespace

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
âœ… This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

Disallows the use of irregular whitespaces in the code.

### Why is this bad

The use of irregular whitespaces can hinder code readability and
create inconsistencies, making maintenance and collaboration more challenging.

### Example

```javascript
function invalidExample() {
  return 42;
}
```
