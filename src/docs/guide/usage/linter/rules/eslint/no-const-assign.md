# eslint/no-const-assign

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
âœ… This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does
Disallow reassigning const variables

### Why is this bad?
We cannot modify variables that are declared using const keyword.
It will raise a runtime error.

### Example
```javascript
const a = 0;
a = 1;
```
