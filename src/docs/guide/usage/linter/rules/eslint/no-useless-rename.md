# eslint/no-useless-rename

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
âœ… This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow renaming import, export, and destructured assignments to the same name.

### Why is this bad?

It is unnecessary to rename a variable to the same name.

### Example

```javascript
// Bad
import { foo as foo } from "foo";
const { bar: bar } = obj;
export { baz as baz };

// Good
import { foo } from "foo";
const { bar: renamed } = obj;
export { baz };
```
