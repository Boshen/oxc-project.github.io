# eslint/no-new-native-nonconstructor

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
âœ… This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow new operators with global non-constructor functions (Symbol, BigInt)

### Why is this bad?

Both new Symbol and new BigInt throw a type error because they are functions and not classes.
It is easy to make this mistake by assuming the uppercase letters indicate classes.

### Example
```javascript
// throws a TypeError
let foo = new Symbol("foo");

// throws a TypeError
let result = new BigInt(9007199254740991);
```
