# eslint/no-duplicate-case

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
âœ… This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow duplicate case labels

### Why is this bad?

If a switch statement has duplicate test expressions in case clauses,
it is likely that a programmer copied a case clause but forgot to change the test expression.

### Example

```javascript
var a = 1;
switch (a) {
  case 1:
    break;
  case 1:
    break;
  case 2:
    break;
  default:
    break;
}
```
