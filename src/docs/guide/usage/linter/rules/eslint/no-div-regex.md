# eslint/no-div-regex

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="fix">
üõ†Ô∏è An auto-fix is available for this rule.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow equal signs explicitly at the beginning of regular expressions.

### Why is this bad?

Characters /= at the beginning of a regular expression literal can be confused with a
division assignment operator.

### Example
```javascript
function bar() { return /=foo/; }
```
