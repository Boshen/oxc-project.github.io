# eslint/no-var

### What it does
ECMAScript 6 allows programmers to create variables with block scope instead of function scope using the `let` and `const` keywords.
Block scope is common in many other programming languages and helps programmers avoid mistakes

### Why is this bad?
Using `var` in an es6 environment triggers this error

### Example
```javascript
// error
var x = "y";
var CONFIG = {};

// success
let x = "y";
const CONFIG = {};
```
