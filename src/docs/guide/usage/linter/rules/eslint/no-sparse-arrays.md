# eslint/no-sparse-arrays

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
✅ This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow sparse arrays.

### Why is this bad?

The confusion around sparse arrays is enough that it’s recommended to avoid using them unless you are certain that they are useful in your code.

### Example
```javascript
var items = [,,];
var colors = [ "red",, "blue" ];
```
