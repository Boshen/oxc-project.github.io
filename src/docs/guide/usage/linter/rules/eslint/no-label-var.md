# eslint/no-label-var

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Disallow labels that share a name with a variable.

### Why is this bad?

This rule aims to create clearer code by disallowing the bad practice of creating a label
that shares a name with a variable that is in scope.

### Example

```javascript
var x = foo;
function bar() {
  x: for (;;) {
    break x;
  }
}
```
