# eslint/no-ternary <Badge type="info" text="Style" />

<div class="rule-meta">
</div>

### What it does

Disallow ternary operators

### Why is this bad?

The ternary operator is used to conditionally assign a value to a variable. Some believe that the use of ternary operators leads to unclear code.

### Example

```javascript
var foo = isBar ? baz : qux;
```

## How to use

To **enable** this rule in the CLI or using the config file, you can use:

::: code-group

```bash [CLI]
oxlint --deny /no-ternary
```

```json [Config (.oxlintrc.json)]
{
  "rules": {
    "/no-ternary": "error"
  }
}
```
