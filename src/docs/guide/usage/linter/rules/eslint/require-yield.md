# eslint/require-yield

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
âœ… This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

This rule generates warnings for generator functions that do not have the yield keyword.

### Why is this bad?

Probably a mistake.

### Example
```javascript
function* foo() {
  return 10;
}
```
