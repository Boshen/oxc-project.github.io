# eslint/no-delete-var

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
âœ… This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

The purpose of the delete operator is to remove a property from an object.

### Why is this bad?

Using the delete operator on a variable might lead to unexpected behavior.

### Example
```javascript
var x;
delete x;
```
