# eslint/no-compare-neg-zero

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
✅ This rule is turned on by default.

### What it does

Disallow comparing against -0

### Why is this bad?

The rule should warn against code that tries to compare against -0,
since that will not work as intended. That is, code like x === -0 will
pass for both +0 and -0. The author probably intended Object.is(x, -0).

### Example

```javascript
if (x === -0) {
}
```
