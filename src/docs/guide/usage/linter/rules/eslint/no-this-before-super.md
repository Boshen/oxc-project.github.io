# eslint/no-this-before-super

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
âœ… This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does
Requires calling `super()` before using `this` or `super`.

### Why is this bad?
Getters should always return a value.
If they don't, it's probably a mistake.

### Example
```javascript
class A1 extends B {
    constructor() {
        // super() needs to be called first
        this.a = 0;
        super();
    }
}
```
