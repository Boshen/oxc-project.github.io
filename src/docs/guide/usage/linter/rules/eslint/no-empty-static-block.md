# eslint/no-empty-static-block

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
✅ This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

Disallows the usages of empty static blocks

### Why is this bad?

Empty block statements, while not technically errors, usually occur due to refactoring that wasn’t completed.
They can cause confusion when reading code.

### Example

```javascript
class Foo {
  static {}
}
```
