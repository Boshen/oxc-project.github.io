# eslint/no-unused-labels

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
✅ This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
<span class="fix">
🛠️ An auto-fix is available for this rule.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow unused labels

### Why is this bad?

Labels that are declared and not used anywhere in the code are most likely an error due to incomplete refactoring.

### Example

```javascript
OUTER_LOOP: for (const student of students) {
  if (checkScores(student.scores)) {
    continue;
  }
  doSomething(student);
}
```
