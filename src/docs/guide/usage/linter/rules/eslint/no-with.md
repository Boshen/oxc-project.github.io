# eslint/no-with

### What it does

Disallow `with` statements

### Why is this bad?

The with statement is potentially problematic because it adds members of an object to the current scope, making it impossible to tell what a variable inside the block actually refers to.

### Example

```javascript
with (point) {
  r = Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y); // is r a member of point?
}
```
