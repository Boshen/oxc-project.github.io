# eslint/for-direction

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
âœ… This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does

Disallow "for" loop update causing the counter to move in the wrong direction.

### Why is this bad?

A for loop that is known to run infinitely or never run is considered a bug.

### Example

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i--) {}

for (var = 10; i >= 0; i++) {}
```
