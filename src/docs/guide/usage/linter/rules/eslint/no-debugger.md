### What it does

Checks for usage of the `debugger` statement

### Why is this bad?

`debugger` statements do not affect functionality when a debugger isn't attached.
They're most commonly an accidental debugging leftover.

### Example

```javascript
async function main() {
  const data = await getData();
  const result = complexCalculation(data);
  debugger;
}
```
