<div class="rule-meta">

âœ… This rule is turned on by default.

### What it does
Disallow reassigning `function` declarations

### Why is this bad?
Overwriting/reassigning a function written as a FunctionDeclaration is often indicative of a mistake or issue.

### Example
```javascript

function foo() {}
foo = bar;
```
