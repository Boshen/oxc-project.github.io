# eslint/no-extra-boolean-cast

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
✅ This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does
This rule disallows unnecessary boolean casts.

### Why is this bad?
In contexts such as an if statement’s test where the result of the expression will already be coerced to a Boolean,
casting to a Boolean via double negation (!!) or a Boolean call is unnecessary.

### Example
```javascript
var foo = !!!bar;
var foo = Boolean(!!bar);

if (!!foo) {}
if (Boolean(foo)) {}

// with "enforceForLogicalOperands" option enabled
if (!!foo || bar) {}
```
