# unicorn/no-thenable

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="default-on">
âœ… This rule is turned on by default.
</span>
</div>

### What it does
disallow `then` property

### Why is this bad?
If an object is defined as "thenable", once it's accidentally
used in an await expression, it may cause problems:


### Example
```javascript
const foo = {
    unicorn: 1,
    then() {},
};

const {unicorn} = await foo;

console.log('after'); //<- This will never execute
```
