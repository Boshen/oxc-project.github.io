# unicorn/number-literal-case

<div class="rule-meta">
<span class="fix">
üõ†Ô∏è An auto-fix is available for this rule.
</span>
</div>

### What it does
This rule enforces proper case for numeric literals.

### Why is this bad?
When both an identifier and a number literal are in lower case, it can be hard to differentiate between them.

### Example
```javascript
// Fail
const foo = 0XFF;
const foo = 0xff;
const foo = 0Xff;
const foo = 0Xffn;

const foo = 0B10;
const foo = 0B10n;

const foo = 0O76;
const foo = 0O76n;

const foo = 2E-5;

// Pass
const foo = 0xFF;
const foo = 0b10;
const foo = 0o76;
const foo = 0xFFn;
const foo = 2e+5;
```
