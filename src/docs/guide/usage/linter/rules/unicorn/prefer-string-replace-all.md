### What it does

Prefers [`String#replaceAll()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replaceAll) over [`String#replace()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace) when using a regex with the global flag.

### Why is this bad?

The [`String#replaceAll()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replaceAll) method is both faster and safer as you don't have to use a regex and remember to escape it if the string is not a literal. And when used with a regex, it makes the intent clearer.

### Example
```javascript
